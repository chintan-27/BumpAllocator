# BumpAllocator
A modern, high-performance bump allocator written in C++17/20. Designed for precise control over memory layout, object lifetimes, alignment, and allocation patterns. Includes typed allocation, destructor tracking, multi-buffer fallback, thread safety, and custom operator new integration â€” with debug logging, CLI demos, and optional GUI visualization.
